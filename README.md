# 2048 [![AppVeyor](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/s1rcheese/2048/master.svg?maxAge=60)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/s1rcheese/2048)

My take the 2048 game in C#. Console version. The implementation is pretty customizable. You can tweak the size of the canvas and the probabilities of 2s and 4s, etc. Just compile and run from console. Should work with both .NET and Mono.

Here's how it looks like: ![screenshot](doc/screenshot.png "Screenshot")

## Running

If you want to run from command line type in
```shell
dotnet run --project 2048
```
